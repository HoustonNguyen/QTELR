## Always change to your branch before working!

#### Regular Process:
  1. Switch to your branch/working branch
  2. Sync changes
  3. Do some changes/work
  4. Sync changes (if someone else was working) and verify everything still works
  5. Commit changes, use smart summary and description
  6. Sync
  7. Your changes are now pushed live
  
#### Merging:
  1. Make sure your branch has been commited and sync'd
  2. Switch to branch you want to merge your changes in to
  2. Sync changes, if you're worried then don't sync and select/submit a pull request and someone will check it
  3. Select compare, pick your branch, and click update from 'my branch'
  4. Load your IDE and make sure everything still works
  5. Then sync the changes and you're done
